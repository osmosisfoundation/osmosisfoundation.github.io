      <title>Preprint your publications on BioRxiv</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BioRxiv is the new home to pre-print publications for all disciplines involved
in clinical drug development and therapeutics! Check out the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/52&#34;&gt;Drug
Development and Clinical Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt; (#ddct) channel on the well-know &lt;a href=&#34;http://biorxiv.org/&#34;&gt;BioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;
pre-print site (channels are listed in a menu on the upper right side of the
main page). Pre-prints provide rapid dissemination of knowledge with an
opportunity to receive dynamic and continuous feedback from multiple reviewers
that can improve the quality of your publication.  We believe pre-prints are an
essential but missing link in our rapidly growing field of quantitative clinical
sciences that support clinical drug development and therapeutic management. You
can learn more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMgY8Dx9co&#34;&gt;pre-prints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwAMtT3ZIpg&#34;&gt;Biorxiv&lt;/a&gt; by watching the videos in the links.
Submitting your manuscripts to biorxiv’s #ddct channel requires 2 simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit your manuscript through the regular submission route of biorxiv that can
be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a #ddct Tag to the end of your manuscript abstract to get
listed in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/52&#34;&gt;Drug Development and Clinical Therapeutics channel&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition
to this tag, you can include multiple other tags that are listed &lt;a href=&#34;http://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/52&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in the
“Instructions for authors”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your manuscript will be sent out to moderators who will oversee the content and
approve the pre-print. The moderator’s job is primarily to ensure that the
manuscript is a rigorous scientific work in an area consistent with the scope of
the #ddct channel. Review of the details of the manuscript is left to the
community who have access to a discussion board for each manuscript. This will
facilitate an open peer review process designed to help authors improve their
work before submitting to a peer-reviewed journal. A revised and refined
manuscript after open peer-review can still be submitted to any standard journal
of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking moderators from different time zones around the world, at least
1-2 from each continent.  Moderators will serve for a one year term at the end
of which can nominate other colleagues to serve.  If you would like to nominate
yourself or a colleague, please send an email to the contacts listed below with
the subject “Intent to moderate #ddct biorxiv”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send all questions and comments to -
@vijay or @kyleb via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.go-isop.org/t/preprint-your-publications-on-biorxiv/868&#34;&gt;discussion in the Biorxiv category
thread on the ISoP discuss forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
