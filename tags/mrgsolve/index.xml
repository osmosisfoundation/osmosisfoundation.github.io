      <description>&lt;p&gt;mrgsolve facilitates simulation in R from hierarchical, ordinary differential equation (ODE) based models typically employed in drug development. The modeler creates a model specification file consisting of R and C++ code that is parsed, compiled, and dynamically loaded into the R session. Input data are passed in and simulated data are returned as R objects, so disk access is never required during the simulation cycle after compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
